# Main info

This project is my implementation of an inspiring [design](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1370314670930501378/high-landing-the18-design-free (made by Oleg Poturemskiy)) created by Oleg Poturemskiy, which I discovered on Figma. The design really caught my attention, and I was excited to bring it to life. The result is a fully functional, responsive website that maintains the essence of the original design while adding interactive elements to enhance the user experience. To ensure accessibility, I replaced the original font, ['Neue Machina'](https://www.typewolf.com/neue-machina), with a similar free Google font, ['Space Grotesk'](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Space+Grotesk).
